# Linkibot - A small automation tool.

## How it works?


![](assets/profile.png)

This is a random person, he has a title with **Sr. Software Engineer | Consultant**
---
Linkibot checks the persons title, if you put the **sr** keyword in that keywords list, it will send an invite to him. If you put **engineer** to the keywords list, it will send an invite to him. 

It's that easy. 


## Getting started 

#### Installation with PIP
